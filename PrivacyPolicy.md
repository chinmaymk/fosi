Fosi Privacy Policy
---

**No Personal Information is collected Using Fosi**

Everything Fosi does is on device, there's no server to talk to, no data to collect. What you browse should be your business and not someone else's.

**Children's Privacy**

Fosi doesnâ€™t collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

**Query suggestions**

Fosi sends keywords entered in search box to Google to provide query recommendations. Requests are made anonymously, ie without the notion of a google account. While this may reduce the amount of "typing" users need to do, it does communicate some basic information such as ip address, and partial keywords that may have been entered in the search box. Fosi has no control over how Google processes this internally and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2021-01-01
